# No requests are allowed to come from the network. The host will be

# FIREWALL CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

# These affect the final firewall output.
# They can also be set in the firewall config file.

# This controls how 'optimal' or 'accurate' the iptables statements
# generated will be.
# 'optimal' generates a production state firewall optimized for speed.
# It makes FireHOL accept all packets of ESTABLISHED connections at the
# beginning of the firewall, thus practically eliminating the need for
# filtering ESTABLISHED traffic. Packet filtering is only done for NEW
# sockets.
# 'accurate' generates a firewall that precisely matches all packets in both
# directions: client->server and server->client
# This setting affects logging, accounting and stateless rules.
# When it is set to 'optimal', logginng will only log the first packet of NEW
# sockets, accounting will only account the first packet of NEW sockets and
# stateless rules are disabled.
# When it is set to 'accurate', logging and accounting will be done for all
# packets and stateless rules are enabled.
# Default: accurate
# Possible Values: optimal accurate
FIREHOL_RULESET_MODE="accurate"

# Should we drop all INVALID packets always?
# INVALID packets as seen by the connection tracker.
# Check also the next section (SYSTEM CONFIGURATION) for related options.
# It can be enabled per interface using 'protection invalid'.
# This will be enabled if you use the synproxy helper.
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_DROP_INVALID=1

# When FIREHOL_DROP_INVALID=1 shall we also log the droped packets?
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_LOG_DROP_INVALID=1

# the action to be performed when we drop INVALID packets
FIREHOL_DROP_INVALID_ACTION="DROP"

# If set to 1, FireHOL will accept unmatched outbound RST packets.
# This is needed when the firewall is expected to reject orphan
# routed connections.
# Default: 0
FIREHOL_ACCEPT_OUTPUT_UNMATCHED_TCP_RST=0

# If set to 1, FireHOL will silently drop orphan TCP packets with ACK,FIN set.
# In modern kernels, the connection tracker detects closed sockets
# and removes them from memory before receiving the FIN,ACK from the remote

# To silently drop these packets, enable this option.
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_IPV4_ICMP_TYPE3=1

# If enabled FireHOL will create a chain per server/client statement and jump
# to it from the main flow. Normaly this jump is only required for clarity.
# So it is advised to leave this setting to 0, for a more efficient firewall.
# Default: 0
FIREHOL_CHAIN_PER_SERVICE=0

# If enabled, FireHOL will use the multiport matches of iptables, when
# possible. Note that multiport matches in iptables do not support matching
# both source and destination ports on the same statement, with different
# ports for source and destination.
# So, FireHOL will only use it if sport or dport in set to 'any' (or not at
# all) or when sport and dport are the exactly the same ports.
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_SUPPORT_MULTIPORT=1

# There are matches that are more "expensive" than others. When enabled,
# FireHOL will use branching (create a new chain and jump to it) in order to
# avoid executing expensive matches more than once per statement.
# Expensive matches are: limit, connlimit, ipset (not when used in src/dst),
# helpers (for RELATED matches).
# Default: 1

# How to configure conntrack helper assignement?
#
# 'kernel'  = the kernel will attempt to match RELATED sockets for all
#             conntrack helpers and all traffic matching its predefined rules.

#             Check: https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/
#
# 'firehol' = FireHOL will generate rules in the 'raw' table, using the -j CT

#             the conntrack helpers are used.
#             CAUTION: FireHOL generated statements are not NAT aware.
#             You should only use this, if you don't NAT traffic that have to

#
# 'manual'  = You configure conntrack helper assignement manually using
#             the 'cthelper' firehol helper.
#             In this case, neither the kernel nor FireHOL will do anything

# IPTABLES MARKS BITMASKING

# FireHOL allows multiple independent MARKs.
# By default FireHOL requires 'connmark' and 'usermark'.

# Mark types may be defined with this template:
#
# markdef NAME VALUES [stateful|stateless] [permanent|temporary]
#
#  NAME      = a name for this mark type
#              connmark and usermark should always be defined.
#
#  VALUES    = max number of marks to support (0 to VALUES - 1)
#              VALUES must be a power of two.
#
#  stateful  = all statements that assign this mark should 
#              only apply it on NEW packets.
#
#  stateless = all statements that assign this mark type should
#              only apply it only to traffic matched by the
#              optional rule parameters given.
#
#  temporary = do not save/restore to/from connection marks.
#              This means RESPONSES to the matched packets
#              will not get the mark.
#
#  permanent = save/restore to/from connection marks
#              This means that RESPONSES will get the mark.
#
# NOTES ABOUT markdef OPTIONS
#
# default is : stateful permanent or default
#              in this mode, only NEW packets of connections need
#              to be marked. ESTABLISHED and RELATED packets
#              will automatically get the same mark too.
#              So, in FireHOL mark helpers (connmark, mark, custommark)
#              you will only need to match a REQUEST packet and
#              automatically all the packets of the connection will
#              get the mark.
#
#            - stateful temporary
#              In this mode, only NEW packets will be marked for each
#              connection. ESTABLISHED and RELATED packets will NOT
#              get the mark.
#
#            - stateless permanent
#              In this mode, whatever the helper statement matches
#              will get the mark. This mark will also be applied to
#              all the packets that are encountered after the marked
#              packet and are part of the same socket.
#
#            - stateless temporary or classic
#              In this mode, only whatever the helper statement matches
#              will get the mark. Nothing else.
#

# clear the internal marks - do not remove this line
markdef clear

# connmarks are used by the connmark helper
markdef connmark 64

# usermark are used by the mark helper
markdef usermark 128

# Custom mark example:
#
# markdef qosmark 8
#
# To use it use 'custommark' helper and optional rule parameter.
# The first argument to both should the mark name (qosmark in this case)
